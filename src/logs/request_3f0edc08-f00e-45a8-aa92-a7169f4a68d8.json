Analysis  \n- Parse `failed_json`.  \n- For each key (e.g. `\"PC1\"`), note its `name`, `critical_compliance_concern`, and why it failed.\n\n### 2. Summarization  \nWrite one paragraph listing each failed ID with its name and main issue.\n\n### 3. Recommendations  \nUnder each compliance ID, produce exactly two numbered items:\n\n\n\n### 4. Rephrase Prompt  \nTransform the **exact text** of `original_prompt` so that:\n- It mitigates all identified issues\n- Preserves the user’s original intent\n- Would pass all compliance checks\n\n## Output Format\nProduce **only** this JSON object (no Markdown fences, no extra keys):\n\n{  \n  \"Aggregated Summary\": \"<your one-paragraph summary>\",  \n  \"Recommendations\": {  \n    \"<CategoryID>\": [  \n      \"1. <Cat name>: <first recommendation>\",  \n      \"2. <Cat name>: <second recommendation>\"  \n    ],  \n    \"…\": [\"…\"]  \n  },  \n  \"Rephrase Prompt\": \"<new compliant prompt>\"  \n}\n"
