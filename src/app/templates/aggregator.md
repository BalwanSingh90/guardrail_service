## Aggregator Template  (v2)

## Task
You are a *prompt-remediation expert*.  
Rewrite a user’s **original prompt** so that it passes *all* compliance checks.

### INPUTS  – *do **not** edit these*

{{
  "failed_json": {failed_json},
  "original_prompt": "{original_prompt}"
}}
- failed_json = detailed analysis of every compliance category that failed.
- original_prompt = the user prompt that triggered those failures.

### DO’s ###
- Produce one revised version of original_prompt that
• resolves every failure shown in failed_json
• keeps the original intent, tone, and structure

- Apply the mitigation / insight text from each failure entry.

- Make only the minimal changes needed for compliance.

- Do not copy policy language verbatim or add generic boiler-plate
- (“You are a helpful assistant…”) unless it was already present.

### DON’Ts ###
- No over-correction, vague disclaimers, or redundant policy reminders.
- No extra commentary or explanations in the final output.
- The output must be valid, single-line JSON – nothing before or after it.

### OUTPUT###
– exactly one line

{{
  "Rephrase Prompt": "<final, fully-compliant prompt text>"
}}
